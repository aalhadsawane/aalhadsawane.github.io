I've came across many features and added the ones that suit my design.
Here are the salient features-


-Added a |JUMBOTRON| in the header section

-Added a |STICKY TOP NAVBAR| which scrolls past until we reach the bottom of the Jumbotron and 
 then becomes fixed to the top.

-The sticky top navbar is |RESPONSIVE|. A |HAMBURGER ICON| takes place of the contents of navbar
 when the width is |LESS THAN 600 PIXELS|. Here I learned about media queries.

-The navbar contains |DROPDOWNS ,LINKS AND AN IMAGE(MY INITIALS)|. Here I learned about 
 |DATA-TARGETS AND OTHER DATA AND ARIA ATTRIBUTES|.

-The dropdown has |BLOCK LINKS, HEADERS AND SEPERATORS|.

-Added |GRADIENT IN HR TAG|.

-Added |RESPONSIVE CARDS WITH STRETCHED LINKS| for describing my work experience. These 
 cards run on the |BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM| AND a |FLEX DISPLAY|.

-Added |FLEXBOXES| in "Skills" and "Experience" divisions for BETTER AND BUG-FREE LAYOUT.

-Added a |CAROUSAL| for showing my top projects. Explored various |CAROUSAL DATA ATTRIBUTES|
 to configure the carousal accordingly.

-Added a |FOOTER WITH COPYRIGHT NOTICE AND SOCIAL MEDIA FONT-AWESOME-ICONS|. I've added hover
 effects in it. Here I learned |ATTRIBUTES LIKE TRANSORM AND TRANSLATE|.

-Added a |RESPONSIVE BACK TO TOP BUTTON|. The button remains in the social media logo row when
 the screen width is greater than 700 pixels and becomes a fixed button (position: fixed) when
 the width is more than 700 pixels. Here I learned using |MEDIA QUERIES|.

-Learned about |TRANSITIONS, ANIMATIONS AND KEYFRAMES|.

-Made several |DESIGNS AND COLOUR SCHEMES| in hard notebooks and finally chose one for my website.

-Added several |HOVER EFFECTS| and other effect on "a" tag's active, visited and other components.

-Made sure the hover effects were not added to touch screen devices.(used @media(hover:none) and (pointer:coarse))
