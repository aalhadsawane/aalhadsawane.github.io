I've came across many features and added the ones that suit my design.
Here are the salient features-


-Added a |jumbotron| in the header section

-Added a |sticky top navbar| which scrolls past until we reach the bottom of the Jumbotron and 
 then becomes fixed to the top.

-The sticky top navbar is |responsive|. A |hamburger icon| takes place of the contents of navbar
 when the width is |less than 600 pixels|.

-The navbar contains |dropdowns ,links and an image(my initials)|. Here I learned about 
 |data-targets and other data and aria attributes|.

-The dropdown has |block links, headers and seperators|.

-Added |gradient in hr|.

-Added |responsive cards with stretched links| for describing my work experience. These 
 cards run on the |bootstrap grid system.|

-Added a |flexbox| in "Skills" division for better and bug-free layout.

-Added a |carousal| for showing my top projects. Explored various |carousal data attributes|
 to configure the carousal accordingly.

-Added a |footer with copyright notice and social media font-awesome-icons|. I've added hover
 effects in it. Here I learned |attributes like transorm and translate|.

-Added a |responsive back to top button|. The button remains in the social media logo row when
 the screen width is greater than 700 pixels and becomes a fixed button (position: fixed) when
 the width is more than 700 pixels. Here I learned using |media queries|.

-Learned about |transitions, animations and keyframes|.

-Made several |designs and colour schemes| in hard notebooks and finally chose one for my website.

-Added several |hover effects| and other effect on "a" tag's active, visited and other components.
